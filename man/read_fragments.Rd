\item{file_path}{path to the file.}

\item{range}{read the entire file if \code{range} is \code{NULL}.}
}
\description{
A fragment data file is essentially just a BED file. The reason we need a
special function here to load a fragment data file is that, by convention,
the data frame should contain a column representing MAPQ scores. However, the
data file may not have a column header. Therefore, we may need to guess which
column represents MAPQ scores.
